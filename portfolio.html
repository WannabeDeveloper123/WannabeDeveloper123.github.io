    <p>Glad to see you're interested in my portfolio! Apart from this awesome loft I made, here's a list of personal projects I've worked over the years to convince people I actually love coding.</p>
    <div class="floating-tile">
        <img 
            src="" 
            alt="Vishal's Personal Logo" 
            class="tile-image" 
        />
        <div class="tile-text">
          <h2 class="tile-heading">Workoutly!</h2>
          <p>
            Don't let the simple terminal based UI fool you into thinking this is "hello world" code. Workoutly is armed with LLaMA 3 (Meta's version of ChatGPT) to provide you a personalized workout plan based on your goal, preferences, disabilities, and illnesses.
            And yes, it dynamically chooses your target muscle depending on which muscle groups you haven't targetted. If that doesn't motivate you enough, Workoutly gamifies your workout routine by calculating XP for every workout you complete.
          </p>
          <p>For the purposes of this website, I also LOVE coding! I figured you would've known it looking at the effort I put into making my loft, but it's perfectly alright if you don't. :)</p>
