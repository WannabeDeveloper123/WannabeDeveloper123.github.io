          <p>
            In case you haven't noticed already, I'm Vishal Murali Kannan, and you're in my loft. Welcome! Argubaly the best Brawl Stars player on the planet, I love grinding that game. But, don't for a second think that I don't touch grass. In fact, you could argue that I touch it too hard at times.
            I could not count the number of times I go for a dive in spikeball only to end up with my face dug into the ground, and the ball right where it was. But, it was good fun. (Especially when I fake my opponent with convincing taps ,:)) 
            Oh, and I've also played football (soccer for my American friends) for my school team. In fact, we had an undefeated season for the past two tourneys in HS.
          </p>
          <p>For the purposes of this website, I also LOVE coding! I figured you would've known it looking at the effort I put into making my loft, but it's perfectly alright if you don't. :)</p>

        <p>
          Singapore, if you haven't known, is a tiny island country located on the peninsular tip of Malaysia. In fact, Singapore is so small that you'd have to look at the world map through a microscope to find where it's located. 
          It's a country where you could get from one end to the other while watching a Coldplay concert (yikes!)... unless you end up behind a truck doing 40 on the passing lane. Putting my witty metaphors aside, I'll admit, it does get pretty hot out there. 
          Anyway, here's a pic of the famous Marina Bay Sands Hotel, which I've taken about a thousand times considering Singapore's my home for the past 12 years. (I love elderly women screaming at me for taking a seat on the bus!)
